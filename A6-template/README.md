## Assignment Reflection

What did you notice about the differences in runtime across algorithms as you changed the number of cards you were sorting? If you had to split them into "slower" algorithms vs "faster" algorithms, which would you put in each category?

Predictions: I think that merge sort and insertion sort will be the "faster" algorithms because you don't need random access for merge sort and it cuts things in half every run. And I think Quick sort will take the longest because you don't have random access and you just have to keep comparing to your pivot and then put all the cards togther at the end.

Noticings: 


Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

The most challenging was the timers in phase 2 because for some reason they weren't working for me even FakeSortTimer wasn't working because it couldn't find the main method. I ended up fixing it by the correct command. 

The most interesting aspect was
